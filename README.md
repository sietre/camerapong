This project was generated using the p5js and handsfree.js libraries to create a game of pong that used the player’s camera to move the paddle to the left or right. The code runs using a local server or by importing it into the p5js online editor.

The only file most of the files are imported libraries for the code to run. The sketch.js file is where the magic happens. The file itself contains code to manipulate the canvas under the p5js library, which is for interactive creativity using the JavaScript canvas.

The handsfree library handles the webcam work so that it tracks the user’s hands with the camera. A dot is created and follows the hand so that the paddle knows where to go. This library is not very well documented and took quite a bit of research to understand how to use.

There is a mode to switch to keyboard controls in case the camera starts to really slow down and affect the game as well.
